## Ultrakill Fighting

A 2D fighting game inspired by classics like _Street Fighter_ and _Mortal Kombat_, set in the fast-paced world of _Ultrakill_. It uses original models, sounds, and textures from the base game to deliver an intense and stylized combat experience. This is a personal, non-commercial fan project.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Core fighting mechanics are implemented. The final build is done, but there is some bugs with the two player controllers and the game loop is incomplete. Upcoming features include advanced combo systems, additional characters, basic AI for single-player mode, and main menu of the game.

## Reflection

  - ### What was the context for this project?
    This project originally began as a universitary assignment, but over time it evolved into a personal passion project. Inspired by the game _Ultrakill_, it became a way to dive deeper into combat systems, animations, and game mechanics using Unity beyond the original academic scope.
  - ### What were you trying to build?
    A non-commercial fighting game that blends the style of retro fighters with the fast and brutal aesthetic of _Ultrakill_. The goal was to create a fun and playable tribute to the original game.
  - ### What made this challenging?
    It was my first time making a fighting game and using animations with root motion in Unity. 
  - ### What were some unexpected obstacles?
      - Creating a functional hitbox system that feels fair and responsive.
      - Developing a basic AI opponent for single-player mode (in progress).
  - ### Tools used:
      - Game Engine: Unity
      - Language: C#
      - Sprite/Texture Editing: Photoshop
      - Audio Tools: Audacity
 
This project was a university assignment for an animation class in a degree in game development course. The task was to create a simple two-player martial arts fighting game in Unity, featuring hand-animated characters with keyframed movements, no motion capture or retargeting allowed. Each student was responsible for animating their own character and implementing gameplay features like local versus play, sound effects, and gamepad support.
After completing the assignment, I decided to continue developing it independently, turning it into a full parsonal project. I expanded on the original concept by incorporating characters and aesthetics from _Ultrakill_, improving mechanics, visuals, and planning for more features beyond the scope of the original university brief.
